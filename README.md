# Discord-Custom-Status-auto-updater

This is a project that will update your Discord Custom status automatically. It is nearly fully customizeable! You can change the text, emojis, time, and presence (online/idle/dnd).

## Features

- Control custom status!
- Set a delay or expiry!
- Control presence (online/idle/dnd/auto)!
    - Can appear online/idle/dnd indefinitely or auto-update based on current presence
- Emoji support!
- Can now support both API endpoints!

## Installation

You can git clone this directory.

Make sure that you have [python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) installed.
```
git clone https://github.com/Mr-FuzzyPenguin/Discord-Custom-Status-auto-updater.git
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

You can use `status-updater.py` directly. Pass the appropriate arguments, your user token, present status, API, comments file, and emojis file (optional).

## Contributing
This is the exact file that I run on my discord account. I'm not that funny, so I basically made this project to outsource humor. If you would like to donate your own witty comment, please do so [here](https://forms.gle/MEC4ZDRdkSATmgM1A)!

I am not accepting any merge requests. This was mainly intended as a showcase of this ~~very im~~practical project. If you would like to help me discover how the Nitro emojis would react with the protobuf encoding, please friend request [my discord account. I change my discord name often!](https://discordlookup.com/user/499285426369069079) So, that is why I didn't attach a tag, but you can still lookup my username! This is furthered by the upcoming username-switch implementation that Discord is coming up with soon.
## Roadmap

- (DONE) Better Terminal UI for better quality of life [5/5]
- (DONE) Arg parse so you can pass files for greater customizability [5/5]
- (DONE) Switching off `requests` [5/5]
- (soon) support for one-time change custom-status [2/5]

#### Potential future ideas:
- Nitro support (but only if someone contributes, since I have no Nitro)
    - GIF and custom emoji support!
